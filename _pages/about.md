I'm currently seeking PhD opportunities for Fall 2026.
I'm a 4th-year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at The Ohio State University, advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao">Dr. Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao</a>.
My research interests include diffusion model unlearning, model merging, and benchmarking multimodal large language models (MMLMs).
